# Advancing Genetic Algorithms and Their Applications
A Practical Guide to Algorithm Mechanics, Parameter Tuning, and Optimization Strategies
I'm writing this paper because genetic algorithms are a powerful tool for solving optimization problems, inspired by natural selection. What interests me is their mathematical foundation, like how ideas from neural networks and graph theory can improve their performance.
In terms of applications, genetic algorithms are versatile. I've used them to optimize decision trees, fine-tune hyperparameters, and improve feature selection in predictive models. They've also been useful for optimizing loss functions, time series forecasting, and even causal inference.
This paper will break down the mechanics of genetic algorithms, supported by math and examples. I'll also show how activation functions from neural networks can push the boundaries of what these algorithms can achieve.
